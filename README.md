This repository introduces Defect Prevention Efficiency (DPE), a shift-left metric for measuring early defect prevention effectiveness in Agile development.

# Defect Prevention Efficiency (DPE) - A Shift-Left Testing Metric

## Introduction
Defect Prevention Efficiency (**DPE**) is a metric designed to measure the effectiveness of shift-left practices in preventing defects **before** they reach later development stages. This metric was introduced by Ehtesham Ahmed in March, 2025.

## Definition
DPE is calculated as:

```
DPE = (Early-stage Defects / Total Defects) × 100
```

Where:
- **Early-stage Defects** = Defects found and fixed during coding, code reviews, static analysis, or unit testing.
- **Total Defects** = Early-stage defects + defects found in later testing (e.g., integration, system, UAT, production).

## Example Calculation
- **Early-stage defects:** 80  
- **Later-stage defects:** 20  
- **Total defects:** 100  

```
DPE = (80 / 100) × 100 = 80%
```

## Interpretation Guidelines
- **High DPE (>70%):** Effective shift-left practices are in place.
- **Moderate DPE (50-70%):** Shift-left practices are working but can be improved.
- **Low DPE (<50%):** Significant room for improvement in early defect detection practices.

## Why DPE Matters?
- Encourages **shift-left testing** by rewarding early defect detection.
- Helps teams **quantify defect prevention effectiveness**.
- Supports **continuous improvement in Agile and DevOps**.

## Implementing DPE
- **Track early defects** using a dedicated issue type in your issue tracker.
- **Visualize DPE trends** in sprint retrospectives.
- **Compare DPE with Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE)** for deeper insights.
